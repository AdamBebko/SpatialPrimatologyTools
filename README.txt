Adam's ArcGIS Tools

NOTE: I developed this package several years ago. I am no longer actively involved in primatology research and am no longer updating this work. 

These tools are discussed in my book chapter:
Bebko, A.O., (2021) Determining the presence of habitual travel route networks in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus morio) in Kutai National Park, Borneo. 
In: Spatial Analysis in Field Primatology. Eds: Dolins, F.L., Shaffer, C.A., Porter, L.M., Hickey, J.R., & Nibbelink, N.P.. Cambridge University Press
